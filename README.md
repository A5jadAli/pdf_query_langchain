# PDFQuery using LangChain and Cassandra
You can talk with your data, where I have use
- LangChain
- OpenAI
- Cassandra DB

You will need following things to use this project on your laptop/pc:
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) account
- [DataStax](https://accounts.datastax.com/session-service/v1/login) account
- You will create your database in Datastax to create your vector database to perfrom vector search and use that while running the code
- You will use your own openai api key

You can use this code to convert it into a streamlit webapp as a mini prokect and make changes in it to talk with any type of documents

Besk of luck!
